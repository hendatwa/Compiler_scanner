# Compiler_scanner
This Java 8 application is a basic lexical analyzer, which is responsible for locating and identifying lexemes in a given input text. Lexemes are the smallest units in a programming language, such as keywords, identifiers, numbers, and symbols. The application reads input from the user, processes it through the lexical analysis stage, and returns tokens that represent identified lexemes.

## Features
```
 *Lexeme Recognition: The application recognizes a set of predefined lexemes, including keywords, identifiers, numbers, and symbols. 	 
 *Token Generation: After identifying lexemes, the application generates corresponding tokens as output.
 *Identifier Recognition: The lexer now identifies identifiers, which are sequences of letters and digits starting with a letter or an underscore. Each identified identifier is returned as a token of type IDENTIFIER.
 *User Interface: The user interface is built using Swing, allowing users to interact with the application through a graphical interface.
